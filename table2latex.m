function table2latex(z, info)
%
% PURPOSE: puts an (n_rows x n_cols) matrix in the Latex2e tabular format with decimal alignment
%                     and commas every three digits in math mode. Optionally places caption and latex label for reference. 
%                     Optionally allows for column and row headings. Optionally writes to a file. Optionally allows control of
%                     precision. Uses booktab package in Latex2e to draw horizontal lines in table (rules).
%                     
%---------------------------------------------------
% USAGE:     latextab2(z, info)
% where:
%        z         = (n_rows x n_cols) matrix (or vector) to be printed. Assume this contains real numbers.
%        info      = a structure containing printing options
%        info.cnames = an (n_cols x 1) string vector of names for columns (optional)
%                      e.g. info.cnames = strvcat('col1','col2');
%                      (default = integer column headings)
%        info.rnames = an (n_rows+1 x 1) string vector of names for rows (optional)
%                      e.g. info.rnames = strvcat('Rows','row1','row2');
%                      (default = integer row labels)
%        info.fmt    = a format string, e.g., '%12.6f' or '%12d' (default = '%25.4f'). Maximum of 9 decimal places. 
%        info.fid = a file to print to supplied in string form (default to screen)
%        info.caption = a string giving the caption or title of the table (default is a blank)
%        info.label = a string giving a latex label to the table (default is a blank)
%                    
%---------------------------------------------------
% EXAMPLES:
%        in.cnames = strvcat('col1','col2');
%        in.rnames = strvcat('rowlabel','row1','row2');
%        in.caption=['Estimates'];
%   
%        latextab2(y, in), prints entire matrix, column headings, row labels, and title of the table
%
%  or: supplying in.fmt with just  one the column, row label fields will result
%        in integer labels for the missing field(s).
%
%  or: latextab2(y) prints entire matrix with integer column headings and integer row labels 
%
%  Try latextab2(randn(10,3)*100000) to see how it works
%
%NOTES:
%
% latextab2 is partially based upon mprint and lprint written by James P. LeSage, www.spatial-econometrics.com
% and on int2str2 written by Olivier Ledoit. It uses the same syntax as mprint and lprint with the addition of caption and label
% fields.
